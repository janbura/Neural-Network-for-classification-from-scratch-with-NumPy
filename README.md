# Neural-Network-for-classification-from-scratch-with-NumPy
In this project, I aim to build a simple neural network from scratch using only the NumPy library in Python. The main focus of this project is to deepen my understanding of the mathematical foundations and internal dynamics of neural networks. The network will be trained to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.
